Founded in <a href=\"1969%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\">1969</a>, the Padres have won two <a href=\"List%20of%20National%20League%20pennant%20winners\">NL pennants</a> — in <a href=\"1984%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\">1984</a> and <a href=\"1998%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\">1998</a>, losing in the <a href=\"World%20Series\">World Series</a> both years. As of <a href=\"2017%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\">2018</a>, they have had 14 winning seasons in franchise history. The Padres are one of two Major League Baseball teams (the other being the <a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels\">Los Angeles Angels</a>) in <a href=\"California\">California</a> to originate from that state; the <a href=\"Oakland%20Athletics\">Athletics</a> were originally from <a href=\"Philadelphia\">Philadelphia</a> (and moved to the state from <a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\">Kansas City</a>), and the <a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\">Dodgers</a> and <a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\">Giants</a> are originally from two New York City boroughs – <a href=\"Brooklyn\">Brooklyn</a> and <a href=\"Manhattan\">Manhattan</a>, respectively. The Padres are the only MLB team that does not share its city with another franchise in the <a href=\"Major%20professional%20sports%20leagues%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada\">four major American professional sports leagues</a>. The Padres are the only <a href=\"List%20of%20American%20and%20Canadian%20cities%20by%20number%20of%20major%20professional%20sports%20franchises%23List%20of%20teams%20by%20urban%20area\">major professional sports franchise</a> to be located in San Diego, following the <a href=\"Relocation%20of%20professional%20sports%20teams\">relocation</a> of the <a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Chargers\">Chargers</a> to <a href=\"Los%20Angeles\">Los Angeles</a> in 2017. They are also the only franchise in the MLB not to have a <a href=\"no-hitter\">no-hitter</a>, having gone 8020 games without throwing one, a major league record to begin a franchise.\\n\\nMinor league team.The Padres adopted their name from the <a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\">Pacific Coast League</a> team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by 18-year-old <a href=\"Ted%20Williams\">Ted Williams</a>, the future <a href=\"Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\">Hall-of-Famer</a> who was a native of San Diego. The team\\'s name, Spanish for \"fathers\", refers to the Spanish <a href=\"Franciscan\">Franciscan</a> <a href=\"friar\">friars</a> who founded <a href=\"Mission%20San%20Diego%20de%20Alcal%C3%A1\">San Diego</a> in 1769.\\n\\nMajor league team.In <a href=\"1969%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\">1969</a>, the Padres joined the ranks of <a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\">Major League Baseball</a> as one of four new expansion teams, along with the <a href=\"Montreal%20Expos\">Montreal Expos</a> (now the <a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\">Washington Nationals</a>), the <a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Royals\">Kansas City Royals</a>, and the <a href=\"Seattle%20Pilots\">Seattle Pilots</a> (now the <a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\">Milwaukee Brewers</a>). Their original owner was <a href=\"C.%20Arnholt%20Smith\">C. Arnholt Smith</a>, a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the <a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres%20%28PCL%29\">PCL Padres</a> whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and <a href=\"Buzzie%20Bavasi\">Buzzie Bavasi</a> as well as a new <a href=\"Qualcomm%20Stadium\">playing field</a>, the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the <a href=\"National%20League%20West\">NL West</a>, losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger <a href=\"Nate%20Colbert\">Nate Colbert</a>, an expansion draftee from the <a href=\"Houston%20Astros\">Houston Astros</a> and still the Padres\\' career leader in home runs.\\n\\nThe team\\'s fortunes gradually improved as they won five <a href=\"National%20League%20West\">National League West</a> titles and reached the <a href=\"World%20Series\">World Series</a> twice, in <a href=\"1984%20World%20Series\">1984</a> and in <a href=\"1998%20World%20Series\">1998</a>, but lost both times. The Padres\\' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was <a href=\"Tony%20Gwynn\">Tony Gwynn</a>, who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, <a href=\"Petco%20Park\">Petco Park</a>, in <a href=\"2004%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\">2004</a>.\\n\\nAs of 2019, the Padres are the only team in MLB yet to throw a no-hitter. On September 5, 1997, <a href=\"Andy%20Ashby\">Andy Ashby</a> took a no-hitter into the 9th inning, which is as close as the team has come to achieving this feat.\\n\\nSpring training.The team has played its spring training games at the <a href=\"Peoria%20Sports%20Complex\">Peoria Sports Complex</a> in <a href=\"Peoria%2C%20Arizona\">Peoria, Arizona</a> since 1994. They share the stadium with the <a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a>.\\n\\nFrom 1969 to 1993, the Padres held spring training in <a href=\"Yuma%2C%20Arizona\">Yuma, Arizona</a> at <a href=\"Desert%20Sun%20Stadium\">Desert Sun Stadium</a>. Due to the short driving distance and direct highway route (170 miles, all on <a href=\"Interstate%208\">Interstate 8</a>), Yuma was very popular with Padres fans, and many fans would travel by car from San Diego for spring training games. The move from Yuma to Peoria was very controversial, but was defended by the team as a reflection on the low quality of facilities in Yuma and the long travel necessary to play against other Arizona-based spring training teams (whose sites were all in the Phoenix and Tucson areas, both rather far from Yuma).\\n\\nLogos and colors.Throughout the team\\'s history, the San Diego Padres have used multiple logos, uniform, and color combinations. Their first logo depicted a <a href=\"friar\">friar</a> swinging a bat with Padres written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres on the exterior of it. The \"Swinging Friar\" has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the \"Swinging Friar\" is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the <a href=\"mascot\">mascot</a> of the team and is now utilized as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.\\n\\nIn 1985, the Padres switched to using a script-like logo in which <i>Padres</i> was written sloped up. That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team\\'s colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the 1990 season.\\n\\nIn 1989, the Padres took the scripted Padres logo that was used from 1985 to 1988 and put it in a gray ring that read \"San Diego Baseball Club\" with a striped center. In 1991, the color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows. In 1991, the team\\'s colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.\\n\\nFor the 2002 season, the Padres removed the stripes off the home jersey and went with a white home jersey with a cleaner look. The pinstripe jerseys were worn as alternate jerseys on certain occasions throughout the 2002 season. The Padres kept this design for two seasons until their 2004 season, in which they moved into their new ballpark.\\n\\nThe logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the 2003 and 2004 seasons, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with <i>San Diego</i> written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team\\'s colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. For the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a gray jersey, with the team typically playing in either blue or sand jerseys on the road and white or blue jerseys at home. In 2009, the <i>San Diego</i> was removed from the top right corner of the logo and two years later, the away uniform changed from sand to gray.\\n\\nFor the 2012 season, the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" adorning the outer circle. The \"swinging friar\" logo was recolored to the current colors of navy blue and white. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year\\'s primary logo below the depiction of <a href=\"Petco%20Park\">Petco Park</a> in sand and above the year of the team\\'s first season (EST. 1969). Until 2015, the blue and sand version was used on the home uniform, while the blue and white version was used on the away and alternate uniforms.\\n\\nIn the 2016 season, the Padres wore a navy blue and yellow color scheme, similar to the one used on the <a href=\"2016%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\">2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a> logo. To coincide with the change, the Padres added a new brown and yellow alternate uniform to be worn mostly during Friday home games.\\n\\nFor the 2017 season, the Padres revealed a new color scheme and new jerseys for the second straight year. The yellow was scrapped from the home uniform and the team reverted to a navy blue-and-white combo. The word <i>Padres</i> returned to the front of the home uniform, but with a new script, while the script on the road uniform reverted to the <i>San Diego</i> wordmark style it used from 2004–11. Despite this major change, the brown and yellow alternate uniform from the previous set was retained.\\n\\nThe club announced on January 25, 2019 that the original brown and gold colors would return for the <a href=\"2020%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\">2020 Major League Baseball season</a>. The new uniform designs featuring the brown and gold colors were officially unveiled on November 9. The team featured brown and gold on each of the three unveiled jerseys, including the return of pinstripes to the Padre home jersey for the first time since 2001 and a non-gray road jersey for the first time since 2010.\\n\\nMilitary appreciation.Starting in 1996, the Padres became the first national sports team to have an annual military appreciation event. Following in 2000, the Padres began wearing a <a href=\"Military%20camouflage\">camouflage</a> to honor the <a href=\"United%20States%20armed%20forces\">military</a>. The jersey will now have had seven different versions since. Starting in 2008, the Padres began wearing camouflage jerseys for every Sunday home game. They also wear these uniforms on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. For 2011, the Padres changed the camouflage design to a more modern \"digital\" design, using the <a href=\"MARPAT\">MARPAT</a> design after receiving permission from then-<a href=\"Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps\">Commandant</a> <a href=\"James%20T.%20Conway\">Conway</a>, and dropped the green from the lettering and logo of the jersey. Green was replaced by a sand-olive color (also in the cap worn with the jersey). For 2016, to coincide with hosting the <a href=\"2016%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\">2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>, the Padres changed the camouflage jersey once again; this time to navy blue, however, this design was only worn for one season as for 2017, the Padres switched the camouflage jersey to Marine, which was used through 2019. For 2020, the Padres will begin using two different camouflage jersey colors: green and sand-olive, both with the current <i>Padres</i> wordmark. Since 1995 Marine Recruits from the nearby <a href=\"Marine%20Corps%20Recruit%20Depot%20San%20Diego\">Marine Corps Recruit Depot</a> often visit the games en masse during Military Appreciation Day, in uniform, often filling entire sections in the upper deck of Petco Park. When they are present, the team commemorates this with a special Fourth Inning Stretch featuring the <a href=\"Marines%27%20Hymn\">Marine Hymn</a>. Through April 2005 over 60,000 marine recruits were hosted by the Padres. This is part of an extensive military outreach program, which also includes a series of Military Appreciation Night games, and <a href=\"Videotape\">game tapes</a> mailed to deployed <a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\">United States Navy</a> ships of the Pacific Fleet for onboard viewing (a large portion of the <a href=\"United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet\">Pacific Fleet</a> is homeported in San Diego).\\n\\nThe <a href=\"San%20Diego%20County\">San Diego area</a> <a href=\"San%20Diego%23Defense%20and%20military\">is home to</a> a number of military installations, including several <a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\">Navy</a> and <a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\">Coast Guard</a> bases centered on <a href=\"San%20Diego%20Bay\">San Diego Bay</a>, <a href=\"Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Miramar\">Marine Corps Air Station Miramar</a> (former home of the <a href=\"United%20States%20Navy%20Strike%20Fighter%20Tactics%20Instructor%20program\">\"Top Gun\"</a> training program), and the <a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\">Marine Corps</a> training ground at <a href=\"Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Pendleton\">Camp Pendleton</a>. Civilians employed at those bases account for around 5% of the county\\'s working population.\\n\\nMascot.The \"Swinging Friar\" is currently the <a href=\"mascot\">mascot</a> of the team. Some in the past have confused <a href=\"The%20Famous%20Chicken\">The Famous Chicken</a> as the mascot of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.\\n\\nBaseball Hall of Famers.The following elected members of the <a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> played and/or managed for the Padres.\\nRetired numbers.The Padres have <a href=\"Squad%20number%23Retired%20numbers\">retired</a> six numbers. Five were in honor of Padre players and one was <a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson\">Jackie Robinson</a>\\'s number 42, which was retired by all of Major League Baseball. The retired numbers are displayed on the upper deck facade behind home plate.\\nThe Padres also have a \"star on the wall\" in honor of broadcaster <a href=\"Jerry%20Coleman\">Jerry Coleman</a>, in reference to his trademark phrase \"Oh Doctor! You can hang a star on that baby!\" Nearby the initials of the late owner <a href=\"Ray%20Kroc\">Ray Kroc</a> are also displayed. Both the star and the initials are painted in gold on the front of the pressbox down the right field line accompanied by the name of the person in white. Kroc was honored in 1984, Coleman in 2001.\\n\\nTeam Hall of Fame.The following 14 people have been inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame since it was founded in 1999.\\n\\nSan Diego Hall of Champions.Gwynn, Winfield, Fingers, Gossage, Randy Jones, and <a href=\"Graig%20Nettles\">Graig Nettles</a> (3B, 1984–1987) are members of the <a href=\"San%20Diego%20Hall%20of%20Champions\">San Diego Hall of Champions</a>, which is open to athletes native to the San Diego area (such as Nettles) as well as to those who played for San Diego teams (such as Gwynn).\\n\\nRadio and television.Padres\\' games are currently televised by <a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20San%20Diego\">Fox Sports San Diego</a>. <a href=\"Don%20Orsillo\">Don Orsillo</a> is the play-by-play announcer, with <a href=\"Mark%20Grant%20%28baseball%29\">Mark Grant</a> as color analyst and either Julie Alexandria, Ron Zinter, or <a href=\"Bob%20Scanlan\">Bob Scanlan</a> as <a href=\"field%20reporter\">field reporter</a>. <a href=\"Mike%20Pomeranz\">Mike Pomeranz</a> hosts the <i>Padres Live</i> pre- and post-game show along with <a href=\"Mark%20Sweeney\">Mark Sweeney</a>.\\n\\nAs of the 2018 season, Padres radio broadcasts in English are carried by <a href=\"KWFN\">KWFN</a> <i>97.3 The Fan</i>, after having previously been carried by <a href=\"sister%20station\">sister station</a> 94.9 <a href=\"KBZT\">KBZT</a> upon the acquisition of the radio rights by <a href=\"Entercom\">Entercom</a> in 2017. <a href=\"Ted%20Leitner\">Ted Leitner</a> is the primary <a href=\"play-by-play\">play-by-play</a> announcer, with Jesse Agler working the middle innings of each game and Bob Scanlan serving as <a href=\"color%20analyst\">color analyst</a>.

Arnholt Smith</a>, a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the <a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres%20%28PCL%29\">PCL Padres</a> whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and <a href=\"Buzzie%20Bavasi\">Buzzie Bavasi</a> as well as a new <a href=\"Qualcomm%20Stadium\">playing field</a>, the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the <a href=\"National%20League%20West\">NL West</a>, losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger <a href=\"Nate%20Colbert\">Nate Colbert</a>, an expansion draftee from the <a href=\"Houston%20Astros\">Houston Astros</a> and still the Padres\\' career leader in home runs.\\n\\nThe team\\'s fortunes gradually improved as they won five <a href=\"National%20League%20West\">National League West</a> titles and reached the <a href=\"World%20Series\">World Series</a> twice, in <a href=\"1984%20World%20Series\">1984</a> and in <a href=\"1998%20World%20Series\">1998</a>, but lost both times. The Padres\\' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was <a href=\"Tony%20Gwynn\">Tony Gwynn</a>, who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, <a href=\"Petco%20Park\">Petco Park</a>, in <a href=\"2004%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season\">2004</a>.\\n\\nAs of 2019, the Padres are the only team in MLB yet to throw a no-hitter. On September 5, 1997, <a href=\"Andy%20Ashby\">Andy Ashby</a> took a no-hitter into the 9th inning, which is as close as the team has come to achieving this feat.\\n\\nSpring training.The team has played its spring training games at the <a href=\"Peoria%20Sports%20Complex\">Peoria Sports Complex</a> in <a href=\"Peoria%2C%20Arizona\">Peoria, Arizona</a> since 1994. They share the stadium with the <a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\">Seattle Mariners</a>.\\n\\nFrom 1969 to 1993, the Padres held spring training in <a href=\"Yuma%2C%20Arizona\">Yuma, Arizona</a> at <a href=\"Desert%20Sun%20Stadium\">Desert Sun Stadium</a>. Due to the short driving distance and direct highway route (170 miles, all on <a href=\"Interstate%208\">Interstate 8</a>), Yuma was very popular with Padres fans, and many fans would travel by car from San Diego for spring training games. The move from Yuma to Peoria was very controversial, but was defended by the team as a reflection on the low quality of facilities in Yuma and the long travel necessary to play against other Arizona-based spring training teams (whose sites were all in the Phoenix and Tucson areas, both rather far from Yuma).\\n\\nLogos and colors.Throughout the team\\'s history, the San Diego Padres have used multiple logos, uniform, and color combinations. Their first logo depicted a <a href=\"friar\">friar</a> swinging a bat with Padres written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres on the exterior of it. The \"Swinging Friar\" has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the \"Swinging Friar\" is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the <a href=\"mascot\">mascot</a> of the team and is now utilized as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.\\n\\nIn 1985, the Padres switched to using a script-like logo in which <i>Padres</i> was written sloped up. That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team\\'s colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the 1990 season.\\n\\nIn 1989, the Padres took the scripted Padres logo that was used from 1985 to 1988 and put it in a gray ring that read \"San Diego Baseball Club\" with a striped center. In 1991, the color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows. In 1991, the team\\'s colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.\\n\\nFor the 2002 season, the Padres removed the stripes off the home jersey and went with a white home jersey with a cleaner look. The pinstripe jerseys were worn as alternate jerseys on certain occasions throughout the 2002 season. The Padres kept this design for two seasons until their 2004 season, in which they moved into their new ballpark.\\n\\nThe logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the 2003 and 2004 seasons, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with <i>San Diego</i> written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team\\'s colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. For the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a gray jersey, with the team typically playing in either blue or sand jerseys on the road and white or blue jerseys at home. In 2009, the <i>San Diego</i> was removed from the top right corner of the logo and two years later, the away uniform changed from sand to gray.\\n\\nFor the 2012 season, the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" adorning the outer circle. The \"swinging friar\" logo was recolored to the current colors of navy blue and white. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year\\'s primary logo below the depiction of <a href=\"Petco%20Park\">Petco Park</a> in sand and above the year of the team\\'s first season (EST. 1969). Until 2015, the blue and sand version was used on the home uniform, while the blue and white version was used on the away and alternate uniforms.\\n\\nIn the 2016 season, the Padres wore a navy blue and yellow color scheme, similar to the one used on the <a href=\"2016%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\">2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a> logo. To coincide with the change, the Padres added a new brown and yellow alternate uniform to be worn mostly during Friday home games.\\n\\nFor the 2017 season, the Padres revealed a new color scheme and new jerseys for the second straight year. The yellow was scrapped from the home uniform and the team reverted to a navy blue-and-white combo. The word <i>Padres</i> returned to the front of the home uniform, but with a new script, while the script on the road uniform reverted to the <i>San Diego</i> wordmark style it used from 2004–11. Despite this major change, the brown and yellow alternate uniform from the previous set was retained.\\n\\nThe club announced on January 25, 2019 that the original brown and gold colors would return for the <a href=\"2020%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\">2020 Major League Baseball season</a>. The new uniform designs featuring the brown and gold colors were officially unveiled on November 9. The team featured brown and gold on each of the three unveiled jerseys, including the return of pinstripes to the Padre home jersey for the first time since 2001 and a non-gray road jersey for the first time since 2010.\\n\\nMilitary appreciation.Starting in 1996, the Padres became the first national sports team to have an annual military appreciation event. Following in 2000, the Padres began wearing a <a href=\"Military%20camouflage\">camouflage</a> to honor the <a href=\"United%20States%20armed%20forces\">military</a>. The jersey will now have had seven different versions since. Starting in 2008, the Padres began wearing camouflage jerseys for every Sunday home game. They also wear these uniforms on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. For 2011, the Padres changed the camouflage design to a more modern \"digital\" design, using the <a href=\"MARPAT\">MARPAT</a> design after receiving permission from then-<a href=\"Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps\">Commandant</a> <a href=\"James%20T.%20Conway\">Conway</a>, and dropped the green from the lettering and logo of the jersey. Green was replaced by a sand-olive color (also in the cap worn with the jersey). For 2016, to coincide with hosting the <a href=\"2016%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\">2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>, the Padres changed the camouflage jersey once again; this time to navy blue, however, this design was only worn for one season as for 2017, the Padres switched the camouflage jersey to Marine, which was used through 2019. For 2020, the Padres will begin using two different camouflage jersey colors: green and sand-olive, both with the current <i>Padres</i> wordmark. Since 1995 Marine Recruits from the nearby <a href=\"Marine%20Corps%20Recruit%20Depot%20San%20Diego\">Marine Corps Recruit Depot</a> often visit the games en masse during Military Appreciation Day, in uniform, often filling entire sections in the upper deck of Petco Park. When they are present, the team commemorates this with a special Fourth Inning Stretch featuring the <a href=\"Marines%27%20Hymn\">Marine Hymn</a>. Through April 2005 over 60,000 marine recruits were hosted by the Padres. This is part of an extensive military outreach program, which also includes a series of Military Appreciation Night games, and <a href=\"Videotape\">game tapes</a> mailed to deployed <a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\">United States Navy</a> ships of the Pacific Fleet for onboard viewing (a large portion of the <a href=\"United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet\">Pacific Fleet</a> is homeported in San Diego).\\n\\nThe <a href=\"San%20Diego%20County\">San Diego area</a> <a href=\"San%20Diego%23Defense%20and%20military\">is home to</a> a number of military installations, including several <a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\">Navy</a> and <a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\">Coast Guard</a> bases centered on <a href=\"San%20Diego%20Bay\">San Diego Bay</a>, <a href=\"Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Miramar\">Marine Corps Air Station Miramar</a> (former home of the <a href=\"United%20States%20Navy%20Strike%20Fighter%20Tactics%20Instructor%20program\">\"Top Gun\"</a> training program), and the <a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\">Marine Corps</a> training ground at <a href=\"Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Pendleton\">Camp Pendleton</a>. Civilians employed at those bases account for around 5% of the county\\'s working population.\\n\\nMascot.The \"Swinging Friar\" is currently the <a href=\"mascot\">mascot</a> of the team. Some in the past have confused <a href=\"The%20Famous%20Chicken\">The Famous Chicken</a> as the mascot of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.\\n\\nBaseball Hall of Famers.The following elected members of the <a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> played and/or managed for the Padres.\\nRetired numbers.The Padres have <a href=\"Squad%20number%23Retired%20numbers\">retired</a> six numbers. Five were in honor of Padre players and one was <a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson\">Jackie Robinson</a>\\'s number 42, which was retired by all of Major League Baseball. The retired numbers are displayed on the upper deck facade behind home plate.\\nThe Padres also have a \"star on the wall\" in honor of broadcaster <a href=\"Jerry%20Coleman\">Jerry Coleman</a>, in reference to his trademark phrase \"Oh Doctor! You can hang a star on that baby!\" Nearby the initials of the late owner <a href=\"Ray%20Kroc\">Ray Kroc</a> are also displayed. Both the star and the initials are painted in gold on the front of the pressbox down the right field line accompanied by the name of the person in white. Kroc was honored in 1984, Coleman in 2001.\\n\\nTeam Hall of Fame.The following 14 people have been inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame since it was founded in 1999.\\n\\nSan Diego Hall of Champions.Gwynn, Winfield, Fingers, Gossage, Randy Jones, and <a href=\"Graig%20Nettles\">Graig Nettles</a> (3B, 1984–1987) are members of the <a href=\"San%20Diego%20Hall%20of%20Champions\">San Diego Hall of Champions</a>, which is open to athletes native to the San Diego area (such as Nettles) as well as to those who played for San Diego teams (such as Gwynn).\\n\\nRadio and television.Padres\\' games are currently televised by <a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20San%20Diego\">Fox Sports San Diego</a>. <a href=\"Don%20Orsillo\">Don Orsillo</a> is the play-by-play announcer, with <a href=\"Mark%20Grant%20%28baseball%29\">Mark Grant</a> as color analyst and either Julie Alexandria, Ron Zinter, or <a href=\"Bob%20Scanlan\">Bob Scanlan</a> as <a href=\"field%20reporter\">field reporter</a>. <a href=\"Mike%20Pomeranz\">Mike Pomeranz</a> hosts the <i>Padres Live</i> pre- and post-game show along with <a href=\"Mark%20Sweeney\">Mark Sweeney</a>.\\n\\nAs of the 2018 season, Padres radio broadcasts in English are carried by <a href=\"KWFN\">KWFN</a> <i>97.3 The Fan</i>, after having previously been carried by <a href=\"sister%20station\">sister station</a> 94.9 <a href=\"KBZT\">KBZT</a> upon the acquisition of the radio rights by <a href=\"Entercom\">Entercom</a> in 2017. <a href=\"Ted%20Leitner\">Ted Leitner</a> is the primary <a href=\"play-by-play\">play-by-play</a> announcer, with Jesse Agler working the middle innings of each game and Bob Scanlan serving as <a href=\"color%20analyst\">color analyst</a>.

There was also a shrine to the Palaci in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted. The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain; one legend made the Palici the sons of Zeus, or possibly Hephaestus, by Aetna or Thalia, but another claimed that the Palici were the sons of the Sicilian deity Adranus.\\n\"}"
